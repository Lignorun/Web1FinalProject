This project will be a children's games website created using PHP and a MySQL database, aimed at offering a question-and-answer style game with several levels and user account functionalities. Here is a breakdown of the main tasks, features, and technical requirements:

### Main Features and Functionalities

1. **User Account Management**
   - **Sign-Up**: Registration form with fields for username, password (with confirmation), first name, and last name. Validations will ensure unique usernames and proper format.
   - **Real-Time Validation**: Using AJAX to verify form fields as the user types, providing instant feedback for incorrect entries.
   - **Sign-In**: Login form to authenticate users, with error messages for incorrect details and a link to reset forgotten passwords.
   - **Password Reset**: A password change form allowing users to reset their passwords with proper validation.
   - **Sign-Out and Time-Out**: Logout function, with an automatic timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.

2. **Game Levels and Mechanics**
   - Six levels of a sorting and identification game involving random numbers and letters.
   - Each level has specific tasks, such as arranging letters in ascending or descending order or identifying the smallest and largest elements.
   - The player has six lives, and the game outcome is recorded as a win, game over, or incomplete (e.g., if the player abandons the game).

3. **Game Abandonment and History**
   - The ability to abandon a game in progress and have it marked as incomplete in the game history.
   - A history page displaying past game results for all players, with details such as the outcome, lives used, and the date/time of completion.

4. **Database Integration**
   - Utilizing a MySQL database to manage user information, game outcomes, and history.
   - Secure data handling and storage with functions like `password_hash()` for encrypting passwords.
   - Automatic database setup using provided SQL scripts, which will ensure consistent structure across environments.

5. **UI and UX Enhancements**
   - Custom styling and media to make the interface engaging for children.
   - A navigation menu to allow easy access to features like sign-up, sign-in, game history, and logout.
   - Tooltips or FAQ to explain game rules and account requirements.

### Development Process

1. **Team Collaboration**
   - Roles are assigned to each team member for streamlined development.
   - A GitHub repository for code sharing and regular updates.

2. **Directory and Code Structure**
   - Proper directory organization (e.g., `css`, `js`, `images` folders).
   - Code reusability through functions and object-oriented programming, separating classes and logic where applicable.
   - Structured HTML layout with a consistent header, footer, and navigation bar.

3. **Testing and Iteration**
   - Functional testing by other teams, with modifications based on feedback.
   - Final evaluation and oral presentation of the completed project.

4. **Documentation**
   - A README file for project overview, setup, and usage instructions.

### Additional Technical Specifications

- HTML components should include a `<head>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`, ensuring smooth navigation across pages.
- PHP best practices include using `stripslashes()`, `strip_tags()`, and `htmlentities()` for data sanitation and using comments and consistent indentation for readability.
  
This detailed approach will help you structure and develop the children's games website efficiently, covering both front-end interactivity and back-end data management. Let me know if you'd like help with specific sections, such as setting up AJAX or PHP session management!
